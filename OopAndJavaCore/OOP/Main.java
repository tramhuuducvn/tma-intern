/**
 * OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm
 * based on the concept of "objects." An object is a software entity that
 * combines data and behavior (methods) into a single unit.
 * 
 * In OOP, programs are organized around objects that interact with each other
 * to accomplish tasks. These objects are instances of classes, which are
 * templates or blueprints for creating objects. A class defines the properties
 * and methods that all objects of that class will have.
 * 
 * The four fundamental concepts of OOP are:
 * 
 * Encapsulation: This is the principle of hiding the internal details of an
 * object and providing only a public interface through which other objects can
 * interact with it. This helps to maintain the integrity and consistency of the
 * object's data.
 * 
 * Abstraction: This involves representing complex real-world concepts in a
 * simplified form, by focusing only on the relevant details and ignoring the
 * rest. Abstraction is achieved in OOP through the use of classes and objects.
 * 
 * Inheritance: This is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the
 * properties and methods of another class. Inheritance allows for code reuse
 * and promotes modular design.
 * 
 * Polymorphism: This is the ability of objects of different classes to be
 * treated as if they are of the same type. Polymorphism is achieved through
 * method overriding and method overloading.
 * 
 * OOP is widely used in modern software development because it promotes code
 * reuse, modularity, and maintainability. It is supported by many programming
 * languages, including Java, Python, and C++.

/**
 * OOP brings several benefits for programmers, including:
 * 
 * Reusability: OOP allows programmers to reuse existing code by creating new
 * objects that inherit the properties and methods of existing objects. This
 * promotes code reuse, reduces development time, and makes it easier to
 * maintain and update software systems.
 * 
 * Modularity: OOP promotes modular design by breaking down complex systems into
 * smaller, more manageable objects. This makes it easier to develop, test, and
 * maintain software, and makes it easier to scale up systems as needed.
 * 
 * Abstraction: OOP allows programmers to represent complex real-world concepts
 * in a simplified form, by focusing only on the relevant details and ignoring
 * the rest. This makes it easier to understand and work with software systems,
 * and makes it easier to change or improve the behavior of objects without
 * affecting other parts of the system.
 * 
 * Encapsulation: OOP provides a way to encapsulate the data and behavior of an
 * object into a single unit, which can be accessed and manipulated only through
 * a well-defined interface. This improves the reliability and security of the
 * code, and makes it easier to change or improve the behavior of an object
 * without affecting other parts of the system.
 * 
 * Polymorphism: OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different
 * classes to be treated as if they are of the same type. This makes it easier
 * to write generic code that can work with different types of objects, and to
 * create systems that can adapt to changing requirements.
 * 
 * Overall, OOP promotes good software design principles, such as code reuse,
 * modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. These principles
 * make it easier to develop, test, maintain, and scale software systems, and
 * make it easier for programmers to write high-quality, reliable, and
 * maintainable code.
